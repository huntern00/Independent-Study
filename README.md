# Performance Evaluation of Cryptography Algorithms
# Course Desription: 
The study requires the performance comparison between three cryptographic algorithms. Three algorithms
are identified and criteria (e.g. objects to encrypt) for their evaluation are set. The algorithms are exercised
under various payloads. Collected data are analyzed to make perofrmance determinations and report the
results.

# Student Learning OutCome:
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Describe three cryptographic algorithms.
- Use three cryptographic algorithms to encrypt and decrypt.
- Identify, create and establish parameters for algorithm performance evaluation.
- Perform load tests
- Collect data and analyze results
- Report and present results of the entire study

# Abstract: 
Cryptography is the study of techniques for secure communication. We know cryptography can 
be used in many ways, but we wanted to test the performance of a handful of algorithms. Using 
some different text inputs, we were able to compare the difference in speeds of the algorithms 
picked. The result was that 3DES has a longer encryption time when compared to RSA and SHA-256 but RSA has a longer encryption time compared to 3DES. 
Keywords: algorithms, cryptography, encryption, decryption, hashing, public/private keys
