# Independent-Study - Performance Evaluation of Cryptography Algorithms
# Course Desription: 
The study requires the performance comparison between three cryptographic algorithms. Three algorithms
are identified and criteria (e.g. objects to encrypt) for their evaluation are set. The algorithms are exercised
under various payloads. Collected data are analyzed to make perofrmance determinations and report the
results.

# Student Learning OutCome:
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
• Describe three cryptographic algorithms.
• Use three cryptographic algorithms to encrypt and decrypt.
• Identify, create and establish parameters for algorithm performance evaluation.
• Perform load tests
• Collect data and analyze results
• Report and present results of the entire study
