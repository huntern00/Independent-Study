We're coming from the future. It's going to be amazing. 
All of the amazing people that are doing really good. 
The other thing that's so great about it is that everybody is really motivated. Everybody is saying, "Wow, it's been so long for us. 
So many people who helped make us great. So much love and respect. All the people who have been my mentors over the years are all now doing well. 
We have been fortunate to have some wonderful friends in this game as well because of all your efforts. 
It's been really fun to be on this team. I couldn't be happier. 
I didn't know about it until I heard there was a tournament. 
There wasn't a tournament, and I was thinking, what the hell do I do there? I was like, 
"I gotta get involved with this team," But i've never had that opportunity in my entire life. That was one thing that really made me want to go and join the team to bring that team to new york. 
You've been one of the best in the world. You play for a different team. It's a pretty good feeling. You're a big part of the team. 
Like, I feel really good there and it's nice to be on the other side. So I can't say enough how much it has helped me to get back in the game. 
I'm very happy with the state of the game and the development process...
